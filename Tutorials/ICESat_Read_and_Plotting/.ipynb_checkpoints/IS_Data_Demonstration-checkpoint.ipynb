    "# ICESat Data Tutorial\n",
    "---\n",
    "This notebook is designed to give you a first look at ICESat data (the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite). There are a range of data products generated from the raw output of the instrument, which fall into categories defined by the processing level:\n",
    "\n",
    "* L1a -- Reconstructed, unprocessed data at full resolution (no sane person would ever look at L0 data)\n",
    "* L1b -- [The lowest level we would ever look at] -- Derived geophysical parameters at the same resolution as the L1a data\n",
    "* L2  -- [The most common level to use] -- Data, derived from L1b products, that has been spatially or temporally resampled, and analyzed for additional geophysical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We will be focused on a single L2 product:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GLAH12  -- Ice Sheet Products (like surface elevation) are stored in the GLAH12 file, which is what we are using here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data dictionary (which contains a full breakdown of variables) can be found here: https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/hdf5_products/data_dicts/GLAH12_data_dict.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "To look at the data, I start by importing a series of modules that will be useful for reading and plotting the data."

    "Surface elevation with respect to the ellipsoid at the spot location determined by the ice-sheet specific range after instrument corrections, atmospheric delays and tides have been applied. The saturation elevation correction (d_satElevCorr) has not been applied and needs to be added to this elevation. This can be over a one meter correction. If it is invalid then the elevation should not be used. The saturation correction flag (sat_corr_flg) is an important flag to understand the possible quality of the elevation data. The saturation index (i_satNdx) can be used for more understanding of concerns on data quality from saturation effects. Also no correction for pulse spreading from forward scatter has been applied.\n",
